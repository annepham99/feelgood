	<center><p>	 Trust us, you can dance!  
				<br>
				<br>
			No need to be a professional balerina or breakdancer to dance. It's all about moving your body in the way that it feels awesome! Just put on some good music, get in some comfy clothes and just start moving! 
			Of course, be safe! We don't want you to pull a muscle so the best idea is to strech beforehand. 
			Go for it, let everything go!
