	<center><p>	 Trust us, you can dance!  <br>
			No need to be a professional balerina or breakdancer to dance. It's all about moving your body in the way it feels awesome! Just put on some good music, get in some commfy clothes and just start moving! 
			Of course, be safe! No crazy stuff without streching beforehand!
