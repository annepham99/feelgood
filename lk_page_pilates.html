			<br> 
			Most of us have heard of pilates, and that's great! <br>
			Pilates is a wonderful form of exercise. Anyone can do it today, and it can be done anywhere, in the house, in the garden or at the gym! 
			It requires concentration and focus, because you move your body through precise ranges of motion. 
			<br>Pilates lengthens and stretches all the major muscle groups in your body in a balanced fashion, so no extreme muscle tention! It requires concentration and effort so it works on your physical health AND on your mental health, you are training your brain to concentrate. Concentrating on your body, being present with it and finding what feels good or not is essential in Pilates and that's why we recommend it! 
			It is easy to find free, fun and effective videos on YouTube but we do recommend Blogilates for maximum fun! Fun is the priority!
