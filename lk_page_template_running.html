	<center><p>	 Interested in Running? Great!
	    It is not only great for your physical health but also for your mental health! 
	    Yes, we know, it is hard to motivate yourself to get out there and actually do it...But, the action of getting out there and running, or even going for a nice long walk is incredibly therapeutic. 
	    Don't worry about not being as good as you think you should be, that's not the case! Everyone starts somewhere and that is the beauty of it. 
	    So we encourage you, if you can, to go for a nice run and sweat out your worries!
