	<center><p>	 Yoga, Yoga, what a wonderful phrase!
				<br>
				Yoga, with it's many variations, is a practice meant as a restorative and strengthening one. 
				We are in no way experts but we definitely recommend yoga! It can help get over anxiety and depression and you can find wonderful videos online. 
				<br>
				We highly recommend the Yoga with Adriene channel on Youtube, it's great.
